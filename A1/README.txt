Compilation

  - Use javac A1.java
  - use java A1 test.dat

If you get a class file version error then I might have left a class file behind, in that case simply delete it and the program should compile
If it cannot find A1.java then ensure that you are in the correct folder, i.e the default package

Source files

A1.java is located in the default package
All the other files are located in the package me.jacob.assign, that is the folder relative to here me/jacob/assign
